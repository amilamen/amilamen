### Hi there 👋

I'm developer fullstack 🤓🤓**JavaScript**🤓🤓 with some skills in *PHP* and *Java*. 

I work at [**Vyconsulting**](https://vyconsulting-group.com) (@vy-group) with an awesome team. We help many company or business through development of mobile and web apps for growth of their benefits.  

My favourite stack in front-end is **Ionic - Angular - Capacitor/Cordova** because *I ❤️ mobile development as much as web development* and **Nestjs or Laravel** as back-end 😄 

I forget 🤔 I'm firstly 🤓🤓**Electronics and Embedded Systems Engineer**🤓🤓 with focus on *IOT*.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ezchilamen) for fun discussions...

Happy to read your resume also on your profile.
