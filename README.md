I'm **Senior Angular Developer** and **Ionic Developer Expert**.

I work at [**Wetillix**](https://wetillix.com) (@wetillix) with an awesome team. We help many companies or business through development of mobile and web apps for growth of their benefits.  

My favourite stack in front-end is **Ionic | Angular | Capacitor/Cordova** because **I love mobile development as much as web development** and for back-end I use **Express.js | Nestjs**.

I'm firstly **Electronics and Embedded Systems Engineer** with focus on *IOT*.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ezchilamen) for fun discussions.

Happy to read your resume also on your profile.

ðŸ”­ Stay tuned !
