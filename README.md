I'm developer fullstack **JavaScript** with some skills in *PHP* and *Java*. 

I work at [**Vyconsulting**](https://vyconsulting-group.com) (@vy-group) with an awesome team. We help many companies or business through development of mobile and web apps for growth of their benefits.  

My favourite stack in front-end is **Ionic | Angular | Capacitor/Cordova** because **I love mobile development as much as web development** and for back-end I use **Express.js | Nestjs | Laravel**.

I'm firstly ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“**Electronics and Embedded Systems Engineer**ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“ with focus on *IOT*.
